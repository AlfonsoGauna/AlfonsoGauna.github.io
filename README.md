I am a PhD student in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. I hold both a BA and an MA in Economics from Universidad Torcuato di Tella.

My research interests lie at the intersection intersection of macroeconomic theory, finance, and international economics. I have been working on topics related to small open economies, the role of expectations in macroeconomics, labor issues, and sovereign debt in Latin American countries.
